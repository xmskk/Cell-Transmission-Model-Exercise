# Cell-Transmission-Model-Exercise
Exercise problem for the cell transmission model of traffic control

# Setup

The figure below describes the model of a highway stretch that is 4 km long. It is divided into 8 cells (0 ~ 7) with each cell being 500 m long. As depicted, there is one on-ramp at cell 1 and one off-ramp at cell 5.

The highway follows the following properties:
	Jam Density: 120 veh/km/lane 
	Critical Density: 20% of jam density 
	Maximum flow: 2000 veh/h/lane 
The demand profiles for the mainline and the on-ramp is depicted below. The highway does not have any vehicles in the initial state. And the split ratio at the off-ramp of cell 5 is 40%.

# Simulation

To investigate the behavior of the CTM model, Î”t is set to 20 seconds and the simulation was ran for 100 minutes. After the 60-minute mark, both inflow demands were set to 0. The detailed procedure of the code is described as follows:

# Results

The following figures depict the results of the simulation and the resulting VHT and VKT are 692.8 veh*h and 13822.5 veh*km, respectively.
